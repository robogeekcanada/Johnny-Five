The best tutorial i found online for using the TFT 1.44 is:

http://henrysbench.capnfatz.com/henrys-bench/arduino-displays/arduino-1-44-in-spi-tft-display-tutorial/

However is a bit outdated. The Adafruit libraries work, however they need a bit of adjustments when it comes to colors.
These 3 libraries were sufficient for me to make the code work:

#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>    // Core graphics library
#include <Adafruit_ST7735.h> // Hardware-specific library
#include <SPI.h>

Due to the space on the screen, the counter only displays up to deci-seconds.
The code can be easily modified for bigger screens. The TFT 1.44 has a resolution of 128x128

I cleaned up the code and added some comments to guide, however this code is far from optimal. 
Function could be further consolidated, for example use the coordinate screen as inputs and use only one function to display text.
I am happy how it works, it's close to real time, but i didn't bother using interrupts for precise measurement.

Hope this helps you and have fun.
